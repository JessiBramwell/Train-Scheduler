### Overview 

The Train-Scheduler project was an introduction to Googles Firebase Database and Firebase Authentication. It allows you to create an account or sign into an existing account. After a user has signed in they are able to add a train to the train schedule, and edit or delete items on the current list. 

* Create an account with an email and password to make changes to the schedule
* Add a new train with the "Add Train" button or edit an existing one by double clicking on an item from the list. 
* Submit your changes and see them updated on the list
